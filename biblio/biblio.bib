  abstract={We explore the limits of digital video microscopy which is established as a standard method in physics, chemistry and biology. At particle distances close to contact we observe small but systematic deviations between the optically measured and the real particle distances. This difference is caused by the overlap of the optical images between neighboring particles. Exemplarily we discuss the consequences of this effect on pair potential measurements of charge stabilized colloids in confined geometries.}

  abstract = {We describe a set of image processing algorithms for extracting quantitative data from digitized video microscope images of colloidal suspensions. In a typical application, these direct imaging techniques can locate submicrometer spheres to within 10 nm in the focal plane and 150 nm in depth. Combining information from a sequence of video images into single-particle trajectories makes possible measurements of quantities of fundamental and practical interest such as diffusion coefficients and pair-wise interaction potentials. The measurements we describe in detail combine the outstanding resolution of digital imaging with video-synchronized optical trapping to obtain highly accurate and reproducible results very rapidly. },

abstract = "Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) with appropriate surface chemistry have been widely used experimentally for numerous in vivo applications such as magnetic resonance imaging contrast enhancement, tissue repair, immunoassay, detoxification of biological fluids, hyperthermia, drug delivery and in cell separation, etc. All these biomedical and bioengineering applications require that these nanoparticles have high magnetization values and size smaller than 100 nm with overall narrow particle size distribution, so that the particles have uniform physical and chemical properties. In addition, these applications need special surface coating of the magnetic particles, which has to be not only non-toxic and biocompatible but also allow a targetable delivery with particle localization in a specific area. To this end, most work in this field has been done in improving the biocompatibility of the materials, but only a few scientific investigations and developments have been carried out in improving the quality of magnetic particles, their size distribution, their shape and surface in addition to characterizing them to get a protocol for the quality control of these particles. Nature of surface coatings and their subsequent geometric arrangement on the nanoparticles determine not only the overall size of the colloid but also play a significant role in biokinetics and biodistribution of nanoparticles in the body. The types of specific coating, or derivatization, for these nanoparticles depend on the end application and should be chosen by keeping a particular application in mind, whether it be aimed at inflammation response or anti-cancer agents. Magnetic nanoparticles can bind to drugs, proteins, enzymes, antibodies, or nucleotides and can be directed to an organ, tissue, or tumour using an external magnetic field or can be heated in alternating magnetic fields for use in hyperthermia. This review discusses the synthetic chemistry, fluid stabilization and surface modification of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, as well as their use for above biomedical applications. "

abstract = {Suspensions of spherical colloidal particles in a liquid show a fascinating variety of phase behaviour which can mimic that of simple atomic liquids and solids. â€ Colloidal fluids'1â€“4, in which there are significant short-range correlations between the positions of neighbouring particles, and â€ colloidal crystals'5â€“7, which have long-range spatial order, have been investigated extensively. We report here a detailed study of the phase diagram of suspensions of colloidal spheres which interact through a steep repulsive potential. With increasing particle concentration we observed a progression from colloidal fluid, to fluid and crystal phases in coexistence, to fully crystallized samples. At the highest concentrations we obtained very viscous samples in which full crystallization had not occurred after several months and in which the particles appeared to be arranged as an amorphous â€ colloidal glass'. The empirical phase diagram can be reproduced reasonably well by an effective hard-sphere model. The observation of the colloidal glass phase is interesting both in itself and because of possible relevance to the manufacture of high-strength ceramics8.},

  abstract={Systems with short-range attractive and long-range repulsive interactions are able to form mesophases at sufficiently low temperatures. In two dimensions, such mesophases emerge as clusters, stripes or bubbles. Using extensive Monte Carlo simulations we investigate the static and the dynamic properties of such a cluster-forming system over a broad temperature range and for different densities. Via the static properties we analyse how ordering into close packed configurations sets in both at the level of the particles as well as at the level of the clusters. The dynamic properties provide information on how, at low temperature, the motion of individual particles is influenced by the dynamic slowing down of the clusters. Finally, we discuss the different diffusion mechanisms at play at low and intermediate densities.}
